      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm <strong>Diego Crisafulli</strong>, a double major in Computational Arts and 
        Computer Science at Concordia University. My journey into technology started with
        3D modeling and quickly evolved into exploring immersive simulations, AI-driven solutions,
        and VR/AR experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about bridging the gap between <strong>artistic creativity</strong> 
        and <strong>engineering</strong> to develop sustainable solutions that have a 
        meaningful impact on our world. Whether it's leveraging <strong>machine learning</strong>
        for advanced analytics, or creating <strong>interactive VR worlds</strong> for education
        and neuroscience, I constantly seek to push boundaries and learn new techniques.
      </p>
      <h2>My Vision</h2>
      <p>
        My long-term goal is to pioneer clean, immersive technologies that 
        <em>both</em> entertain and drive positive environmental change. 
        From generative AI to real-time simulations, I'm always exploring 
        how technology can inspire and improve lives.
